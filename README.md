# TheColorWheel

A board game project for IT265 based on the Color Wheel

## Game Objective:
This game is an “every man for himself” game, however you must create colors with your opponents in order to move forward on the board. Creating colors by combining cards will lead you to victory. Be smart, persuasive, and strategic. Try to combine with someone that would benefit you more, and put your opponents at a disadvantage.

### Includes: 
Game Board, Rulebook, 80 Cards, 8 Cheat Sheets, Color Wheel

Color Cards: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet, Black, White, Grey

## Game Rules:
### Setup
Every player starts with 5 cards
There is a deck, in which players will pick up a new card after every round. A pile will be created for the discarded cards, if the deck runs out, shuffle and replace the deck with the discarded cards.
### Gameplay
At the beginning of each round, every player must choose a card from their hand, and not show it. Once everyone decides their playing card, everyone reveals it at once and decides who they are combining with. Follow the movement guidelines for movement amounts and legal color combos. After each round, pick up a new card from the deck.
If you did not get a chance to combine, save your card facing up in front of you, this will be your bank. As soon as your bank reaches 3 cards, you may combine any of the 3 (if possible), play on the board, and discard ALL bank cards.
The game ends once the first player finishes the designated laps. 
3 Players (1 Lap)      4-5 Players (2 Laps)      6-8 Players (3 Laps)
In the event of a tie, continue the game until the next corner.

### How to Decide who to Combine With
Try to combine with an opponent that you would benefit from the most, and move more spaces. If two opponents agree to combine, that deal is set, and those players cannot change after they have agreed. Persuade your opponent on why they should combine with you and not someone else.
